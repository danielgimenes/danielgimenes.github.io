<p>With Clickr you can:</p>
<p>- Easily configure tempo and change it during practice<br />
- Supports simple, compound and complex time signatures 4/4, 2/4, 3/4, 5/4, 7/8, 9/8, 11/8 and 12/8<br />
- Pick a custom duration for your training or set it to unlimited<br />
- Save tempo, time signature and duration in presets that can be used later<br />
- Change tempo during the training (no need to stop and start over)<br />
- Configure volume of the metronome with on-screen button (no need to use smartphone buttons)<br />
- Have your first beat of a compass as a higher pitch sound</p>

</center>The app is currently monetised through ads, and a PRO version bought through in-app purchase, which enables having more than 3 presets at a time, removes the ads and allows training with complex and compound time signatures.</p>
